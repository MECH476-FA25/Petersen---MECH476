above YAML to `html_document` for ease of knitting and homework
submission.

This R Markdown (.Rmd) file is a template for your Chapter 4 Homework.
Do everything within this file. Make it your own, but be careful not to
change the code-figure-text integration I set up with the code appendix
and the global options. If you have used R Markdown before and are
comfortable with the extra options, feel free to customize to your
heart's desire. In the end, we will grade the **knitted** PDF or HTML
document from within your private GitHub repository. Remember to make
regular, small commits (e.g., at least one commit per question) to save
your work. We will grade the latest knit, as long as it occurs *before*
the start of the class in which we advance to the next chapter. As
always, reach out with questions via GitHub Issues or during office
hours.

```{r global-options, include = FALSE}
# set global options for figures, code, warnings, and messages
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, fig.path = "../figs/",
                      echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
```

# Ozone data

The corresponding data file (.csv) contains *hourly* ozone data from two
sites in Fort Collins. You should already have this file in your `/data`
folder.

# Preparation

You completed the following steps in your Chapter 3 Homework. If
correct, you should copy-paste the code into this R Markdown document;
FYI, you cannot `source()` R Markdown files for use of its output in
another file because they are intended to be self-contained and
reproducible. Therefore, you need to copy-paste parts of your Chapter 3
Homework into this document and adjust the pathnames, if needed.

## Load R packages

```{r load-packages}
# load packages for current R session
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Import, select, and clean data

Recreate the pipe of `dplyr` functions that you used to import the data,
select and rename the variables listed below, drop missing observations,
and assign the output as a `tibble` (*not in that particular order*).

-   `sample_measurement` renamed as `ozone_ppm` (ozone measurement in
    ppm)
-   `datetime` (date in YYYY-MM-DD format and time of measurement in
    HH:MM:SS)

```{r import-data}
# ozone: import, select, drop missing observations, rename
ppm_and_time <- read_csv("C:/Users/Vance/OneDrive - Colostate/Desktop/Petersen---MECH476/data/ftc_o3.csv") %>% dplyr::select(sample_measurement, datetime) %>% filter(!is.na(sample_measurement), !is.na(datetime)) %>% rename(ozone_ppm = sample_measurement)
```

# XL: If you save your data in "data" folder, which is in the same "Petersen---MECH476" folder with your "homework" folder, then the following code should work and you don't need to quote the full directory. BTW, we will cut each line of code by the end of pipe `%>%`

```{r}
ppm_and_time <- read_csv("../data/ftc_o3.csv") %>% 
  dplyr::select(sample_measurement, datetime) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(sample_measurement), 
         !is.na(datetime)) %>% 
  rename(ozone_ppm = sample_measurement)
```

## Examine Data

Examine the structure and contents of the dataframe to confirm the file
imported and was manipulated properly.

```{r missing-data}
# examine dataframe object 
ppm_and_time
```

# XL: Here, we recommend to use `glimpse()`, `head()`, `tail()`, etc.

# Question 1: `ggplot2` time series

Using `ggplot` and the corresponding `geom`, create a time series of
ozone measurement across time. Warning: This plot will have a very poor
ink-to-information ratio. Ugly plots are okay when you are just
exploring data.

```{r ozone-time}
# create basic time series using ggplot2 package
ppm_and_time %>% ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x = datetime, y = ozone_ppm))
```

# XL: break your code into several lines

```{r}
ppm_and_time %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(x = datetime, y = ozone_ppm))
```

# Question 2: Base R equivalent

For comparison, what function could you use to create a time series of
these data in base R? How does the syntax of this function compare to
that of `ggplot()`?

--\> plot(x,y, type = "p")

ggplot is more streamlined with specific functions for each type of
graph you want. It also adds a lot more customizability to the graphs.

# Question 3: `ggplot` object

Excluding the geom, assign the plot from Question 1 as a `ggplot` object
with a descriptive name.

```{r ozone-object}
# create base layer of ozone time series (no geom) and save to object
ggplot_ozone <- ppm_and_time %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = datetime, y = ozone_ppm))
```

# Question 4: `geom`

Now, add `geom_point()` to the `ggplot` object using the following
syntax: `object_name + geom_point()`. Remember, you have already defined
the `aes()` in the `ggplot` object in Question 3.

```{r ozone-geom}
# add layer to ggplot object
ggplot_ozone + 
  geom_point()
```

# Question 5: `ggplot` layers

Call and examine object within the R Markdown, Console, or using View.
How many layers does this `ggplot` object contain? Why?

1.  This is because the geom_point is the only layer and the dataframe
    and aes are specified within ggplot_ozone.

# Question 6: theme

Next, add the `ggplot2` theme of your choice to the `ggplot` object with
`theme_*()` function prefix.

```{r ozone-theme}
# add theme to ggplot object
ggplot_ozone + 
  theme_light()
```

# Question 7: additions

In addition to assigning a plot as a `ggplot` object, one can also
assign aspects of the figure such as axis labels and titles to an object
for later use. For example:

```{r ozone-labels, eval=FALSE}
# create new object with ggplot labels 
ozone_labels <- labs(x = "Time of Measurement (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)",
                     y = "Ozone Concentration (ppm)",
                     title = "Hourly Ozone Measurements in Fort Collins, CO")
```

Using this technique and the same additive approach
(`ggplot_object + ... + title`) from Questions 5 and 6, add a title and
revise the axis labels.

```{r ozone-time-label}
# add title and axis labels to time series
ggplot_ozone + 
  labs(x = "Time of Sample", 
       y = "Ozone Concentration (ppm)", 
       title = "Hourly Ozone Measurements in Fort Collins, CO")
```

# Question 7: ways to see more granularity

The time series from the previous questions does not look nice. It is
hard to discern granular patterns in the data because of their sheer
density; there are too many hourly measurements over time. We could look
at the data on different time scales, but, because we have not discussed
how to manipulate dates and times, we will instead focus first on adding
transparency to the data points using the `alpha =` aesthetic. Try
recreating the time-series plot with `alpha = 0.2`.

```{r ozone-time-label-alpha}
# add alpha aesthetic to the geom_point()
ggplot_ozone + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2)
```

Alternatively, we could examine just the ozone measurements that exceed
the threshold (0.070 ppm) set by the Environmental Protection Agency.
Filter the dataset to the ozone levels exceeding 0.070 ppm, and use
these data to construct a time series plot with time of measurement on
the x-axis and ozone concentration measurement on the y-axis. Remember
to add the relevant `geom`, title, subtitle, axis labels, and your
choice of theme.

```{r high-ozone-plot}
# filter data to ozone concentration measurements exceeding 0.070 ppm 
ppm_and_time %>% 
  filter(ozone_ppm > 0.07)
# time series of high ozone measurements
ppm_and_time %>% 
  filter(ozone_ppm > 0.07) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = datetime, y = ozone_ppm)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) + 
  labs(x = "Time of Sample", 
       y = "Ozone Concentration (ppm)", 
       title = "Hourly Ozone Measurements in Fort Collins, CO", 
       subtitle = "Exceeding EPA Regulations") + 
  theme_light()
```

# Question 8: seasonality

Based on the time series, do you see any seasonal pattern for higher
levels of ozone? Describe what you see.

The highest levels of ozone occur in early July. July has most of the
higher measurements of ozone

# Question 9: proportion

What proportion of ozone measurements exceed the EPA guidelines? Instead
of plugging in the actual values, make R figure out the length of each
vector and the corresponding proportion in one line of code.

```{r ozone-perc}
# calculate proportion of ozone measurements that exceed 0.070 ppm
paste0(round(sum(ppm_and_time$ozone_ppm > 0.07) / length(ppm_and_time$ozone_ppm) * 100, 2),"%")
```

# Question 10: `ggplot2` extensions

Navigate to [this website](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/)
and browse the `ggplot2` extensions. These themes can be very useful, so
it's good to be aware of them. Which theme would be appropriate for your
own research or senior project, and why? How would you use it? Briefly
describe your data and why the extension would improve the data
visualization and communication.

The ggridges() extension would be the best for my senior design project
at the moment. My main role right now is choosing an option that would
be best at mitigating a pressure spike within an engine intake pipe. The
customization for the ridges would allow me and my team to see and
compare all of my options on the same graph.

# XL: Good job! Just a quick note â€” splitting your code into separate lines helps improve readability for you and anyone else who might use it.
