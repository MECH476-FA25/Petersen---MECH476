# Grading

We will grade the **knitted** PDF or HTML document from within your private
GitHub repository. Remember to make regular, small commits (e.g., at least one
commit per question) to save your work. We will grade the latest knit, as long
as it occurs *before* the start of the class in which we advance to the next
chapter. As always, reach out with questions via GitHub Issues or during
office hours.

# Data

You are probably sick of seeing the ozone data, but there's still more to
do with the file. Ozone concentration measurement is considered univariate,
thus we can use basic exploratory data analysis approaches to examine the data.

# Preparation

Load the necessary R packages into your R session. 

```{r packages, message=FALSE}
# load packages
library("dplyr")
library("ggplot2")
library("readr")
library("knitr")
library("kableExtra")
```

Recreate the pipe of `dplyr` functions that you used to import the data, select
and rename the variables listed below, drop missing observations, and assign the
output with a good name.

- `sample_measurement` renamed as `ozone_ppm` (ozone measurement in ppm)
- `datetime` (date in YYYY-MM-DD format and time of measurement in HH:MM:SS)

```{r import-data, message=FALSE}
# ozone: import, select, drop missing observations, rename
ppm_and_time <- read_csv("C:/Users/Vance/OneDrive - Colostate/Desktop/Petersen---MECH476/data/ftc_o3.csv") %>% dplyr::select(sample_measurement, datetime) %>% filter(!is.na(sample_measurement), !is.na(datetime)) %>% rename(ozone_ppm = sample_measurement)
```

Check that the data imported correctly.

```{r data-check}
# examine dataframe object 
ppm_and_time
```

# Chapter 5 Homework: Exploring Univariate Data

Through Question 5, you will use all of the available ozone measurements
from January 2019 through January 2020. Starting in Question 6, you will use
a subset of the dataset: ozone concentration measurements on July 4, 2019.

## Question 1: Definitions

Guess the location, dispersion, and shape of ozone concentration data, based on
the definitions of each described in the coursebook. No code needed; just use
your intuition. For shape, take a look at the coursebook appendix on reference
distributions.

 - location: values tend to be smaller as ozone concentration is measured in parts per million. I would assume the central tendency to be slight but I'm not sure where it would show up

 - dispersion: The values would likely stay quite similar to each other from one observation to the next

 - shape: The ozone values are most likely cyclic


## Question 2: Quartiles

Calculate the quartiles of `ozone_ppm`. What is the minimum? Maximum? Median? 

```{r ozone-quartiles}
# calculate quantiles of ozone concentration
summary(ppm_and_time)
```

### Extra Credit

Create [a similar table](https://smogdr.github.io/edar_coursebook/eda1.html#descriptive-statistics) for `ozone_ppm`. Hint: You will need to investigate table
options in the `knitr` package.

```{r extra credit}
#summary(ppm) %>% kbl() %>% kable_material(c("striped", "hover"))
```

\newpage

## Question 3: Cumulative Distribution Plot

Using either relevant `ggplot2` `geom` option, create a cumulative distribution
plot of `ozone_ppm`. Tweak the axis ranges for optimal data representation,
using `scale_*_continuous()` with `breaks =` and `minor_breaks =` arguments.
Add axis labels, title, subtitle, and theme. 

```{r ozone-cd}
# plot cumulative distribution of ozone concentration
ppm_and_time %>% ggplot(aes(x = ozone_ppm)) + stat_ecdf() + labs(x = "Ozone measurement (ppm)", y = "Time") + theme_light() + labs(title = "Ozone Data Cumulative Distribution", subtitle = "Jan 2019 - Jan 2020") 
```

\newpage

## Question 4: Histogram

Create a histogram of `ozone_ppm`. Within the `geom`, mess with the number of
bins (e.g., 20, 50, 75, 100, 200) to explore the true shape and granularity of
the data. Match the plot style (e.g., title, subtitle, axis labels, theme) you
chose in Question 3, with the relevant adjustments such as "Histogram" 
instead of "Cumulative Distribution Plot".

```{r ozone-hist}
# create histogram of ozone concentration
ppm_and_time %>% ggplot(aes(x = ozone_ppm)) + geom_histogram(bins = 20) + labs(x = "Ozone measurement (ppm)", y = "Count") + theme_light() + labs(title = "Ozone Data Histogram", subtitle = "Jan 2019 - Jan 2020")
```

### Question 5: Concept

What mathematical concept is a histogram (Q4) attempting to visualize? 

 - The central tendency or frequency distribution of the data

### Question 6: Distribution

Based on the histogram (Q4), does ozone concentration appear to be normally
distributed? 

 - It does not. There is a central tendency around 0.035 ppm

### Question 7: Outliers

Based on the histogram (Q4), do you see any possible outliers? Skewness? How
might this affect the spread and central tendency?

 - There are some outliers around 0.1, but they do not affect the histogram as it is cumulative.

\newpage

## Question 8: Boxplot

Generate a boxplot of ozone concentration on the y-axis with a title, subtitle,
y-axis label, and theme consistent with the style of the previous two plots. 
Use quotes (`""`) as the `x` arguments within the calls to the aesthetic and 
labels to remove the x-axis scale and label.

```{r ozone-boxplot}
# create ozone boxplot

ppm_and_time %>% ggplot(aes(x = "", y = datetime)) + geom_boxplot() + labs(x = "", y = "Count") + theme_light() + labs(title = "Ozone Data Boxplot", subtitle = "Jan 2019 - Jan 2020")

```

\newpage

# Subset Data

Use the following code to create a dataframe for use in the remaining questions.
These ozone concentration measurements were taken on July 4, 2019 in Fort
Collins, CO. This code detects certain characters with the `datetime` object and
filters to observations containing those characters. There are other ways this 
could have been done (e.g., `dplyr::filter()` with `%in%` operator).

```{r ozone-day}
# create subset of data with only one day to examine daily pattern
# I did not ask you to code this because we have not discussed dates or stringr
# You need to uncomment the below three lines and run it; check object names
ozone_day <- ppm_and_time %>% 
dplyr::filter(stringr::str_detect(string = datetime, pattern = "2019-07-04"))
```

## Question 9: Autocorrelation Plot

Define autocorrelation as it relates to ozone concentration measurement. 

Create an autocorrelation plot of ozone concentration, using `stats::acf()` and
include axis labels and title. Describe what you see based on the features of
interest outlined in the coursebook.

```{r ozone-acf}
# create autocorrelation plot with ozone_day df
stats::acf(ozone_day$ozone_ppm, xlab = "Lag (hours)", ylab = "Correlation", main = "Ozone Measurement Correlation on July 4th, 2019")

```
 - The data is cyclic and varies on what looks to be a day/night cycle. The peak predictabilities happen 12 hours apart from each other, and almost all of the data is outside the blue lines.


\newpage

## Question 10: Parial Autocorrelation Plot

Define partial autocorrelation as it relates to ozone concentration measurement.

 - Partial autocorrelation would be how dependent the ozone measurements are upon each other while not considering intermediate measurements

Now create a partial autocorrelation plot of day ozone concentration with axis
labels. Describe what you see. How does this compare to the autocorrelation
plot in the previous question?

```{r ozone-part-acf}
# create partial autocorrelation plot
stats::pacf(ozone_day$ozone_ppm, xlab = "Lag (hours)", ylab = "Partial Correlation", main = "Ozone Measurement Partial Correlation on July 4th, 2019")
```

 - The main difference between the two graphs is that most values are on the negative side of the partial correlation plot, and within the blue lines. the plot also does not appear to be a 12 hour cycle.
 - This means that most data points have little correlation with each other, and alternate up and down
